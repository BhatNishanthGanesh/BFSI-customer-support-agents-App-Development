## React Native Mobile Application for BFSI(Banking, Financial Services and Insurance) Customer Support Agents

## Problem Statement

The primary goal of this project is to deliver a feature-rich mobile application designed for BFSI customer support agents. The key deliverables and expected outcomes include:

* Mobile Application: Develop a user-friendly mobile application for Android and iOS platforms that replicates essential features of Tetherfi Agent Desktop.
* User Authentication: Implement secure login and authentication mechanisms to ensure data privacy and compliance with industry standards.
* Customer Interaction History: Enable agents to access customer interaction transaction history, and details on their mobile devices.
* Communication Tools: Integrate real-time communication tools such as chat, email, and voice calls to facilitate seamless interactions with customers.
* Status Management: Provide functionality for agents to manage status.
* Analytics: Incorporate analytics features to help agents monitor their interactions.

## Solution

The proposed solution is to develop a React Native mobile application that addresses all of the key deliverables and expected outcomes outlined in the problem statement. React Native is a cross-platform mobile development framework that allows developers to build native-looking and performing applications for Android and iOS using a single codebase. This makes it an ideal choice for developing a mobile application that needs to be deployed on both platforms.
